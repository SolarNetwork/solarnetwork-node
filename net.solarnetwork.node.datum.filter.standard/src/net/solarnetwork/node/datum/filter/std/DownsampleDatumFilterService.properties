title = Downsample Datum Filter
desc = This component provides a way to down-sample higher-frequency datum samples into \
	lower-frequency (averaged) datum samples. The filter will collect a configurable number \
	of samples and then generate a down-sampled sample where an <b>average</b> of each \
	collected <i>instantaneous</i> property is included.

status.key = Status
status.desc = Status information about the filtered data sources.

sampleDurationSecs.key = Sample Duration
sampleDurationSecs.desc = A duration in seconds to collect samples within before \
	generating a down-sampled average sample. Overrides the <b>Sample Count</b> \
	setting.

sampleCount.key = Sample Count
sampleCount.desc = The number of samples to collect before generating a down-sampled \
	average sample. If not configured, or <code>&lt;1</code>, then samples will only \
	be collected if the invoking plugin passes a <code>subsample</code> parameter. \
	Consult the documentation for the datum source plugin you wish to use with this \
	filter to see if it handles this.

decimalScale.key = Decimal Scale
decimalScale.desc = A maximum scale (number of digits after the decimal point) to \
	round decimal values to. Set to <code>0</code> to round to whole numbers.

minPropertyFormat.key = Min Property Template
minPropertyFormat.desc = A string format to use for computed minimum property values. \
	Use <code>%s</code> as the placeholder for the original property name, e.g. \
	<code>%s_min</code>.

maxPropertyFormat.key = Max Property Template
maxPropertyFormat.desc = A string format to use for computed maximum property values. \
	Use <code>%s</code> as the placeholder for the original property name, e.g. \
	<code>%s_max</code>.
