title = Timeout Datum Filter
desc = This component provides a way to generate a datum if a matching source ID is not seen within \
	a configurable timeout.

outputSourceId.key = Output Source ID
outputSourceId.desc = The source ID to use for the generated (timeout) datum stream.

timeoutMillis.key = Timeout
timeoutMillis.desc = When greater than <code>0</code> then wait at most this amount of milliseconds for a \
	matching source ID to be seen before generating \
	an empty <em>timeout</em> datum with the <b>Output Source ID</b>. As long as a matching source ID is seen before this timeout occurs, \
	no additional datum will be generated. Input datum are always passed through. This means a datum for <b>Output Source ID</b> will always \
	be generated at <em>at least</em> this frequency: either as an input datum passed through this filter \
	or a timeout datum generated by this filter.

persist.key = Persist Output
persist.desc = If enabled then process and persist the generated timeout datum. Otherwise process the generated \
	timeout datum without persisting them. Input datum are unaffected by this setting.

tagName.key = Tag
tagName.desc = An optional tag to include in generated timeout datum.
	
statusPropertyName.key = Status Property
statusPropertyName.desc = An optional status property to include in generated timeout datum. The value of the property \
	will be <b>Status Value</b>.
	
statusPropertyValue.key = Status Value
statusPropertyValue.desc = If <b>Status Property</b> is configured, the value to use for the status property in \
	generated timeout datum.
