title = SMA inverter (YASDI)

yasdi.propertyFilters['UID'].key = Device
yasdi.propertyFilters['UID'].desc = The SMA device serial number to capture data from, as a base-10 integer.

sourceId.key = Source ID
sourceId.desc = A unique name to give to this specific inverter. If you have more than \
	one inverter, you should give each of them a unique Source ID value, for example \
	<em>Main</em>, <em>Secondary</em>, <em>1</em>, <em>2</em>, etc.

address.key = SMA address
address.desc = The address reported by the SMA inverter.

pvVoltsChannelName.key = PV Volts channel
pvVoltsChannelName.desc = The SMA channel name to capture instantaneous PV voltage \
	values from.

pvAmpsChannelName.key = PV Amps channel
pvAmpsChannelName.desc = The SMA channel name to capture instantaneous PV amp \
	values from.
	
kWhChannelName.key = kWh channel
kWhChannelName.desc = The SMA channel name to capture accumulative kWh production \
	values from.

channelNamesToOffsetDailyValue.key = Daily offset channels
channelNamesToOffsetDailyValue.desc = If configured, a set of channels to treat as \
	ever-accumulating numbers that should be treated as daily-resetting values. This \
	can be used, for example, to calculate a "kWh generated today" value from an \
	<code>E-Total</code>  channel that is not reset by the inverter itself. When \
	reading values on the start of a new day, the value of that channel is persisted \
	so subsequent readings on the same day can be calculated as an offset from \
	that initial value.

debugYasdi.key = Debug Mode
debugYasdi.desc = If enabled, then configure YASDI with debugging to STDERR. This \
	change will only take effect after SolarNode is restarted, and also requires \
	YASDI to have been compiled with debug support.
