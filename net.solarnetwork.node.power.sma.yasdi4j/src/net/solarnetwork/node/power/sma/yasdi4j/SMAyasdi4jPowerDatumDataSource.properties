title = SMA inverter (YASDI)

triggerCronExpression.key = Schedule
triggerCronExpression.desc = A \
	<a href="{0}">\
	cron expression</a> representing the schedule to sample data at.

smaYasdiDatumLoggerJob.smaYasdiDatumLoggerTrigger.key = SMA Inverter Logger 
smaYasdiDatumLoggerJob.smaYasdiDatumLoggerTrigger.desc = Capture inverter data \
	and cache the data on this SolarNode.

deviceSerialNumber.key = Device
deviceSerialNumber.desc = The SMA device serial number to capture data from, as a base-10 integer.

sourceId.key = Source ID
sourceId.desc = A unique name to give to this specific inverter. If you have more than \
	one inverter, you should give each of them a unique Source ID value, for example \
	<em>Main</em>, <em>Secondary</em>, <em>1</em>, <em>2</em>, etc.

groupUID.key = Service Group
groupUID.desc = An optional group to include this service in.

address.key = SMA address
address.desc = The address reported by the SMA inverter.

pvWattsChannelNamesValue.key = PV Watts channels
pvWattsChannelNamesValue.desc = The SMA channel names to capture instantaneous PV watt \
	values from, as a comma-delimited list. The channel values will then be added together \
	to form the overall watt value. If this property is configured, the <code>PV Volts channel</code> \
	and <code>PV Amps channel</code> values will be <b>ignored</b>. For example: \
	<em>A.Ms.Watt, B.Ms.Watt</em>.

pvVoltsChannelName.key = PV Volts channel
pvVoltsChannelName.desc = The SMA channel name to capture instantaneous PV voltage \
	values from.

pvAmpsChannelName.key = PV Amps channel
pvAmpsChannelName.desc = The SMA channel name to capture instantaneous PV amp \
	values from.
	
kWhChannelName.key = kWh channel
kWhChannelName.desc = The SMA channel name to capture accumulative kWh production \
	values from.

otherChannelNamesValue.key = Other channels
otherChannelNamesValue.desc = A comma-delimited list of any other SMA channel names to monitor.

channelNamesToOffsetDailyValue.key = Daily offset channels
channelNamesToOffsetDailyValue.desc = If configured, a set of channels to treat as \
	ever-accumulating numbers that should be treated as daily-resetting values. This \
	can be used, for example, to calculate a "kWh generated today" value from an \
	<code>E-Total</code>  channel that is not reset by the inverter itself. When \
	reading values on the start of a new day, the value of that channel is persisted \
	so subsequent readings on the same day can be calculated as an offset from \
	that initial value.

channelMaxAgeSeconds.key = Channel Maximum Age
channelMaxAgeSeconds.desc = The maximum number of seconds old any channel value is allowed \
	to be accessed as before reading it again from the inverter.

deviceLockTimeoutSeconds.key = Device Lock Timeout
deviceLockTimeoutSeconds.desc = The maximum number of seconds to wait for an exclusive access lock \
	on the configured inverter.
