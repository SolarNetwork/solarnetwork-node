title = Serial port

lockOnOpen.key = Port lock
lockOnOpen.desc = If enabled then use a locking serial port connection that requires exclusive access \
	to the port. Only disable this if required by another plugin.

timeout.key = Port lock timeout
timeout.desc = The maximum number of seconds to wait to acquire exclusive use of the configured port. \
	Multiple components can use the same port, but only one at a time. If one component is using the \
	port and another tries to, the second component will wait at most this many seconds for the first \
	component to finish using the port before giving up.
