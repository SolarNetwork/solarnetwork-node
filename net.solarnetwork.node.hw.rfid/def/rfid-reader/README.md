# RFID Scanner Support

This folder contains a Linux C program `rfid-server` which listens for
TCP/IP connections on port **9090** and writes ASCII string messages to
connected clients. The server will first send a status line which the
client can discard. Then the server will send RFID ID values, one per
line, as they are read from the scanner. If no RFID tags are read
for some time, the server will send a _heartbeat_ to the client in the
form of a single line with the string `ping`.

# OS Level Support

We want the `rfid-server` program to run when the OS boots up, but
it should only start if the RFID scanner device is connected. To
do that we can use **udev** and **systemd** on Debian 8.

## Add udev rule for consistent device naming

The `rfid-server` accepts the path to the system device that represents
the RFID scanner. To make sure the system consistently maps the device
to a known value, set up a **udev** rule that generates a consistent
symlink to the device as well as adding the `systemd` tag so our unit
configuration can refer to this device, for example in a configuration
file `/etc/udev/rules.d/a11-rfid.rules`:

	SUBSYSTEM=="input", ATTRS{idVendor}=="04d9", ATTRS{idProduct}=="1503", SYMLINK+="rfid", TAG+="systemd", ENV{SYSTEMD_WANTS}="rfid-server.service"

This configuration will map the device matching these criteria to `/dev/rfid`.
The rules can be reloaded by running

	udevadm control --reload-rules

## OS user

To read from a `/dev/input/X` device on Debian Linux, the user must
be part of the `input` group. Add a new **rfid** user that is included in
this group, that will run our `rfid-server` program:

	useradd -M -c 'RFID Server' -g input -N -s /bin/false rfid

## systemd service

Finally, add a `systemd` service unit to manage the server, which waits
for the `/dev/rfid` device to be available before launching the program.
The unit file is `/etc/systemd/system/rfid-server.service` and contains:

	# rfid-server systemd service unit

	[Unit]
	Description=RFID server.
	After=dev-rfid.device
	BindsTo=dev-rfid.device
	StopWhenUnneeded=yes

	[Service]
	Type=simple
	User=rfid
	Group=input
	ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/rfid-server /dev/rfid
	Restart=always
	RestartSec=1

	[Install]
	WantedBy=multi-user.target

Then enable this service:

	systemctl enable rfid-server

## Multiple RFID devices

If multiple RFID devices are to be used, then the udev rules can be changed
to include a device number in the symlink:

	SUBSYSTEM=="input", ATTRS{idVendor}=="04d9", ATTRS{idProduct}=="1503", SYMLINK+="rfid%n", TAG+="systemd", ENV{SYSTEMD_WANTS}="rfid-server@rfid%n.service"

which would result in links like `/dev/rfid1`, `/dev/rfid2`, etc.

**Note** that the order the devices are added is undefined, so it probably
makes sense to make the udev rules more specific so they are mapped
consistently, and in that case the `SYMLINK` could be hard-coded, for
example mapping to a specific USB bus:

	SUBSYSTEM=="input", ATTRS{idVendor}=="04d9", ATTRS{idProduct}=="1503", ATTRS{busnum}=="4", SYMLINK+="rfid%n", TAG+="systemd", ENV{SYSTEMD_WANTS}="rfid-server@rfid%n.service"


Then the `systemd` service unit file should change to
`/etc/systemd/system/rfid-server@.service` with content like this:

	# rfid-server systemd service unit

	[Unit]
	Description=RFID server.
	After=dev-%i.device
	BindsTo=dev-%i.device
	StopWhenUnneeded=yes

	[Service]
	Type=simple
	User=rfid
	Group=input
	ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/rfid-server /dev/%I
	Restart=always
	RestartSec=1

	[Install]
	WantedBy=multi-user.target

We can also ask for specific services to be started by creating symlinks like

	systemctl enable rfid-server@rfid2.service

which would make the system start up the server for `/dev/rfid2` on boot.
