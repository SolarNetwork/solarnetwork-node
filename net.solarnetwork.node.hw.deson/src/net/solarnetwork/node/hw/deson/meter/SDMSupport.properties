info.key = Meter Info
info.desc = Information about the meter, if supported.

sample.key = Latest Reading
sample.desc = Overview of the latest reading from the meter.

sourceMappingValue.key = Measurement Sources
sourceMappingValue.desc = A key/value mapping of the measurements you'd like to \
	collect from the meter and their associated <code>sourceId</code> values. The supported \
	measurements are: <b>Total</b>, <b>PhaseA</b>, <b>PhaseB</b>, and <b>PhaseC</b>. \
	The syntax is like <b>Total = Main, PhaseA = A, ...</b>.

deviceTypeValue.key = Model
deviceTypeValue.desc = The SDM meter model.

backwards.key = Backwards
backwards.desc = If active, then assume the meter has been installed backwards \
	with respect to the current direction. Some measurements will then be treated \
	differently when samples are taken (for example negating the <b>watts</b> property).

SDM120.desc = SDM120 single phase power meter.
SDM220.desc = SDM220 single phase power meter.
SDM630.desc = SDM630 three phase power meter.
