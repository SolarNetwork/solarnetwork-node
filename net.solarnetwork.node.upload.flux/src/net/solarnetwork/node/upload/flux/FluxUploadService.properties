title = SolarFlux Upload Service
desc = This component provides a way to post datum captured by SolarNode to SolarFlux (or any compatible \
	MQTT service). This is completely separate from SolarIn: datum posted to SolarFlux are not \
	persisted in SolarNetwork.

status.key = Status
status.desc = Overview statistics on the number of SolarFlux messages processed since SolarNode started.
status.msg = <p class="mt-2">{0}.</p><div class="row"><div class="col">\
	<table class="table table-sm table-striped counts"><tbody>\
	<tr><th>Published datum</th><td>{1}</td></tr>\
	<tr><th>Published bytes</th><td>{2}</td></tr>\
	</tbody></table>\
	</div></div>

status.connected = Connected
status.disconnected = Not connected
status.mqttMessageDaoMissing = Message persistence not available.
status.opModeDoesNotMatch = Not connected because required operational mode [{0}] not active.

mqttHost.key = Host
mqttHost.desc = The URL to the MQTT server to use. Use <code>mqtts</code> for \
	a TLS encrypted connection, or <code>mqtt</code> for no encryption. For example: \
	<code>mqtts://influx.solarnetwork.net:8884</code>.

mqttUsername.key = Username
mqttUsername.desc = The username to connect to the MQTT server with.

mqttPassword.key = Password
mqttPassword.desc = The password to connect to the MQTT server with. <b>Note</b> that SolarNode \
	will provide its X.509 certificate on TLS connections, so a password might not be necessary.

publishQosValue.key = Reliability
publishQosValue.desc = The MQTT quality of service level. The higher the level the more reliable \
	the MQTT message delivery will be, at the expense of higher bandwidth and slower throughput.

mqttQos.0.title = At most once ({0})
mqttQos.1.title = At least once ({0})
mqttQos.2.title = Exactly once ({0})

mqttVersion.key = Version
mqttVersion.desc = The MQTT protocol version to use.

publishRetained.key = Retained
publishRetained.desc = Toggle the MQTT retained message flag. When enabled the MQTT server will store \
	the most recently published message on each topic so it is immediately available when clients connect.

wireLogging.key = Wire Logging
wireLogging.desc = Toggle wire-level MQTT packet logging. This is designed to help developers \
	troubleshoot MQTT communication issues.

requiredOperationalMode.key = Required Mode
requiredOperationalMode.desc = Require an active operational mode to enable publishing data. Leave empty \
	to enable publishing by default.
	
excludePropertyNamesRegex.key = Exclude Properties
excludePropertyNamesRegex.desc = An optional regular expression to globally exclude datum properties from getting \
	published. For example set to <code>_.*</code> to exclude all internal datum properties. \
	This exclusion is applied before any configured Filters.

cachedMessagePublishMaximum.key = Maximum Republish
cachedMessagePublishMaximum.desc = The maximum number of locally cached messages to publish at one time, once \
	a MQTT connection is available again.

mqttMessageDaoRequired.key = Offline Cache Needed
mqttMessageDaoRequired.desc = When enabled then treat the lack of the optional offline persistence database \
	as an error state.

filters.key = Filters
filters.desc = A list of dynamic filters to apply to datum, to throttle sources or filter properties.

filtersItem.key = {0}
filtersItem.desc =

filtersItem.sourceIdRegexValue.key = Source ID
filtersItem.sourceIdRegexValue.desc = A case-insensitive regular expression to match against datum <b>source ID</b> \
	values. If defined, this filter will only be applied to datum with matching source ID values. \
	If not defined this filter will be applied to all datum. \
	For example <code>^solar</code> would match any source ID starting with <b>solar</b>.

filtersItem.datumEncoderUid.key = Datum Encoder
filtersItem.datumEncoderUid.desc = The <b>Service Name</b> of the Datum Encoder component to encode the MQTT \
	payload with. If not defined, or the service is not available, then the default CBOR encoding will \
	be used. Combine with a <b>Source ID</b> filter to use the encoder only with matching source IDs.

filtersItem.transformServiceUid.key = Datum Filter
filtersItem.transformServiceUid.desc = The <b>Service Name</b> of a Datum Filter component to apply to datum \
	before encoding and posting them. Can be a the UID of a specific Datum Filter or a Datum Filter Chain.

filtersItem.requiredOperationalMode.key = Required Mode
filtersItem.requiredOperationalMode.desc = Require an active operational mode to enable this filter. Leave empty \
	to enable at all times.

filtersItem.frequencySeconds.key = Limit Seconds
filtersItem.frequencySeconds.desc = The minimum number of seconds to limit datum that match the configured \
	<b>Source Id</b> pattern. If datum are produced faster than this rate, they will be \
	filtered out. Set to <code>0</code> or leave empty for no limit.

filtersItem.propIncludeValues.key = Property Includes
filtersItem.propIncludeValues.desc = A list of  case-insensitive regular expressions to match against \
	datum property names. If configured, <b>only</b> properties that match one of these expressions \
	will be included in the filtered output. For example <code>^watt</code> would match any \
	property starting with <b>watt</b>.

filtersItem.propIncludeValuesItem.key = {0}
filtersItem.propIncludeValuesItem.desc = 

filtersItem.propExcludeValues.key = Property Excludes
filtersItem.propExcludeValues.desc = A list of  case-insensitive regular expressions to match against \
	datum property names. If configured, <b>any</b> property that match one of these expressions \
	will be excluded from the filtered output. For example <code>^temp</code> would match any \
	property starting with <b>temp</b>. Exclusions are applied <b>after</b> property inclusions.

filtersItem.propExcludeValuesItem.key = {0}
filtersItem.propExcludeValuesItem.desc =
