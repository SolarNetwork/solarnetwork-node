backwards.key = Backwards

sourceMappingValue.desc = A key/value mapping of the measurements you'd like to \
	collect from the meter and their associated <code>sourceId</code> values. The supported \
	measurements are: <b>Total</b>, <b>PhaseA</b>, <b>PhaseB</b>, and <b>PhaseC</b>. \
	The syntax is like <b>Total = Main, PhaseA = A, ...</b>.
