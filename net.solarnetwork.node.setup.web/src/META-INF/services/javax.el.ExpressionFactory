# The service-imp-first in this file is because it's required by jakarta.el:jakarta.el-api:3.0.3 and we treat
# it as _canonical_ EL API Jar
# Its javax.el.FactoryFinder class reads only the first line of this file...
# org.apache.tomcat:tomcat-el skips the comments correctly because it's using generic java.util.ServiceLoader API
