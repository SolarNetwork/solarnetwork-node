# SolarNode Modbus I/O API

This plugin provides a generic API for communicating with Modbus devices. By itself
this plugin does not provide anything: another plugin that implements this API must
be deployed at runtime to provide Modbus integration support, for example the
[Jamod](../net.solarnetwork.node.io.modbus.jamod/) plugin.
