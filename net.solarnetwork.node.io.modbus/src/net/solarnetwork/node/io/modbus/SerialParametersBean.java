/**
 * A JavaBean wrapper around SerialParameters to make working with dependency
 * inject easier.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The {@link SerialParameters} class defines many JavaBean-esque accessor
 * methods, but violates the JavaBeans contract in some cases where different
 * method types are used on the same bean property. For example, the
 * <i>parity</i> property has {#link {@link SerialParameters#getParity()} that
 * returns an <i>int</i> and {@link SerialParameters#setParity(String)} as well
 * as {@link SerialParameters#setParity(int)}. This breaks JavaBean access in
 * some JVMs.
