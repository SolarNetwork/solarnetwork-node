title = SMA SunnyNet inverter

dataCollectorFactory.propertyFilters['uid'].key = Serial port
dataCollectorFactory.propertyFilters['uid'].desc = The <b>Service Name</b> of the serial connection to use for \
	communicating with the SMA inverter.

sourceId.key = Source ID
sourceId.desc = A unique name to give to this specific inverter. If you have more than \
	one inverter, you should give each of them a unique Source ID value, for example \
	<em>Main</em>, <em>Secondary</em>, <em>1</em>, <em>2</em>, etc.

address.key = SMA address
address.desc = The address reported by the SMA inverter.

pvVoltsChannelName.key = PV Volts channel
pvVoltsChannelName.desc = The SMA channel name to capture instantaneous PV voltage \
	values from.

pvAmpsChannelName.key = PV Amps channel
pvAmpsChannelName.desc = The SMA channel name to capture instantaneous PV amp \
	values from.
	
kWhChannelName.key = kWh channel
kWhChannelName.desc = The SMA channel name to capture accumulative kWh production \
	values from.

channelNamesToOffsetDailyValue.key = Daily offset channels
channelNamesToOffsetDailyValue.desc = If configured, a set of channels to treat as \
	ever-accumulating numbers that should be treated as daily-resetting values. This \
	can be used, for example, to calculate a "kWh generated today" value from an \
	<code>E-Total</code>  channel that is not reset by the inverter itself. When \
	reading values on the start of a new day, the value of that channel is persisted \
	so subsequent readings on the same day can be calculated as an offset from \
	that initial value.

channelNamesToResetDailyValue.key = Daily reset channels
channelNamesToResetDailyValue.desc = If configured, a set of channels to reset \
	each day to a zero value. This is useful for resetting accumulative counter \
	values, such as E-Total, on a daily basis for tracking the total kWh generated \
	each day.

synOnlineWaitMs.key = SynOnline delay
synOnlineWaitMs.desc = Number of milliseconds to wait after issuing the \
	SunnyNet <code>SynOnline</code> command. A small wait is often \
	necessary to prevent the first data request when conversing with the \
	from failing.
