title = Operational State Manager
desc = This component listens for changes to operational modes, and can change the operating state \
	of other controls by issuing <code>SetOperatingState</code> instructions. This can be used, for \
	example, to turn devices on/off.
 
info.key = Info
info.desc = Shows if the configured operational state is enabled and this service has issued the \
	corresponding <code>SetOperatingState</code> instructions to the configured controls.
 
mode.key = Operational Mode
mode.desc = The <a href="https://github.com/SolarNetwork/solarnetwork/wiki/SolarNode-Operational-Modes" target="_blank">\
	operational mode <i class="bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a> to listen for.

controlIdsValue.key = Control IDs
controlIdsValue.desc = A comma-delimited list of control IDs to issue <code>SetOperatingState</code> \
	instructions to when the configured mode changes.

enabledStateCode.key = Active State
enabledStateCode.desc = The <a href="https://github.com/SolarNetwork/solarnetwork/wiki/SolarNet-API-global-objects#standard-device-operating-states" target="_blank">\
	operating state <i class="bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a> to apply when the mode is <b>enabled</b>.

disabledStateCode.key = Inactive State
disabledStateCode.desc = The <a href="https://github.com/SolarNetwork/solarnetwork/wiki/SolarNet-API-global-objects#standard-device-operating-states" target="_blank">\
	operating state <i class="bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a> to apply when the mode is <b>disabled</b>.

retryCount.key = Retry Count
retryCount.desc = This count determines how many times the service will re-try applying \
	state changes if an error occurs. If the retry count is <code>0</code> then \
	no retries will be attempted. If the retry count is anything less than \
	<code>0</code>, then the code will attempt an <b>unlimited</b> number of \
	times. Otherwise up to this number of attempts will be performed.

taskTimeoutSecs.key = Max Wait
taskTimeoutSecs.desc = The maximum number of seconds to wait for all controls' state change to be applied.
