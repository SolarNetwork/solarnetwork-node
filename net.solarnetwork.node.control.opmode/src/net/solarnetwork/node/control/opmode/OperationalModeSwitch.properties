desc = This component acts as a boolean switch control that binds a control to an operational mode. Setting \
	the control on/off via a <code>SetControlParameter</code> instruction enables/disables an operational mode, \
	and vice-versa. This can be combined with the <b>Operational State Manager</b> component, for example, to \
	turn devices on/off via the control API.
