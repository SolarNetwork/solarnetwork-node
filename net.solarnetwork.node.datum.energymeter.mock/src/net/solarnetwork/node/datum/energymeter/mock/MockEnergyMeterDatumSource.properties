title = Mock Energy Meter

sourceId.key = Source ID
sourceId.desc = A unique source identifier.
 
voltage.key = RMS Voltage
voltage.desc = RMS of the mock power supply in volts.
frequency.key = Frequency
frequency.desc = Frequency of mock AC power supply, in Hz.
resistance.key = Resistance
resistance.desc = Resistance of the mock circuit, in Ohms.
inductance.key = Inductance
inductance.desc = Inductance of the mock circuit, in mirco Henry.
randomness.key = Toggle Randomness
randomness.desc = Set to true to have voltage and frequency deviate there values.
voltdev.key = Voltage Deviation
voltdev.desc = When randomness is on the source voltage will have random deviations +- this value.
freqdev.key = Frequency Deviation
freqdev.desc = When randomness is on the source frequency will have random deviation +- this value.

resistanceDeviation.key = Resistance Deviation
resistanceDeviation.desc = When randomness is on the resistance will have random deviations +- this value.

inductanceDeviation.key = Inductance Deviation
inductanceDeviation.desc = When randomness is on the inductance will have random deviations +- this value.
