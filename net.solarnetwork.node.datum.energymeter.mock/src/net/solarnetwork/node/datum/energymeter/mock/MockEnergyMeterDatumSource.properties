title = Mock Energy Meter

sourceId.key = Source ID
sourceId.desc = A unique source identifier.
 
voltage.key = RMS Voltage
voltage.desc = RMS of the mock power supply in volts.
frequency.key = Frequency
frequency.desc = Frequency of mock AC power supply, in Hz.
resistance.key = Resistance
resistance.desc = Resistance of the mock circuit, in Ohms.
inductance.key = Inductance
inductance.desc = Inductance of the mock circuit, in mirco Henry.
randomness.key = Toggle Randomness
randomness.desc = Set to true to have voltage and frequency deviate there values.
voltdev.key = Voltage Deviation
voltdev.desc = When randomness is on the source voltage will have random deviations +- this value.
freqdev.key = Frequency Deviation
freqdev.desc = When randomness is on the source frequency will have random deviation +- this value.

resistanceDeviation.key = Resistance Deviation
resistanceDeviation.desc = When randomness is on the resistance will have random deviations +- this value.

inductanceDeviation.key = Inductance Deviation
inductanceDeviation.desc = When randomness is on the inductance will have random deviations +- this value.

metadataServiceUid.key = Metadata Service
metadataServiceUid.desc = The <b>Service Name</b> of the <i>Metadata Service</i> to obtain TOU schedules from.

touMetadataPath.key = TOU Metadata Path
touMetadataPath.desc = The metadata path that will resolve a time-of-use (TOU) schedule from the configured \
	Metadata Service. For example: <code>/pm/mock/my-pv-system</code>.

touLanguage.key = Language
touLanguage.desc = A language to parse the TOU schedule with. If not configured then the default system \
	language will be assumed.

touScheduleCacheTtlSecs.key = TOU Cache TTL
touScheduleCacheTtlSecs.desc = The maximum number of <b>seconds</b> to cache parsed TOU schedule information \
	before reloading from the configured <b>Metadata Service</b>.

touOffsetHours.key = TOU Offset
touOffsetHours.desc = A number of <b>hours</b> to add to the current time when resolving TOU rules.

weatherSourceId.key = Weather Source ID
weatherSourceId.desc = The source ID of a weather datum stream collected on this node to use to influence \
	the output of the energy meter.
