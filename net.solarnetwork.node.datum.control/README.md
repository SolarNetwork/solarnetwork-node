# SolarNode Control Event Datum Logger

This SolarNode plugin provides a component that can generate a datum stream from SolarNode control
values.

![Control Datum Source settings](docs/solarnode-datum-control-settings.png)

The datum generated by this component will use the control's ID value for the datum source ID. For
the control value, if the control defines a specific property name the generated datum will have a
status property with the same name. Otherwise the generated datum will have a status property `val`,
and if the control has a number value an instantaneous property `v` will also be created.

# Install

The plugin can be installed via the **Plugins** page on your SolarNode. It appears under the
**Datum** category as **Control Datum Source**. Once installed, a **Control Datum Source**
component will become available.

# Configuration

Each service configuration contains the following settings:

| Setting               | Description  |
|:----------------------|:-------------|
| Service Name          | A unique name to identify this data source with.                                 |
| Service Group         | A group name to associate this data source with.                                 |
| Control ID            | A regular expression to filter control ID values by, or left blank to generate datum for all control IDs. |
| Mode                  | A control event type to filter by. |

## Control Mode

The **Mode** setting allows you to configure which control events are turned into datum objects:

| Mode | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| Sampled | Emitted when some plugin reads (samples) a control value. |
| Changed | Emitted when a plugin writes (changes) a control value.   |
| Sampled and changed | Generate datum from both **Sampled** and **Changed** control events. |
