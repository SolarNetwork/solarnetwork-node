title = Mock Battery

status.key = Status
status.desc = Overview of the battery status.

status.msg = {0}% capacity ({1} Wh); rate @ {2} W

sourceId.key = Source ID
sourceId.desc = A unique source identifier.
 
targetPowerRateControlId.key = Target Power Rate Control ID
targetPowerRateControlId.desc = A control ID to expose for managing the target power rate. \
	The <code>SetControlParameter</code> instruction can be used to update the control value, \
	passing the desired power rate, in <b>watts</b>. A positive value represents a <em>charge</em> \
	(receive) rate while a negative value represents a <em>discharge</em> (supply) rate.
	
socControlId.key = SOC Control ID
socControlId.desc = A control ID to expose for manipulating the state of charge. \
	The <code>SetControlParameter</code> instruction can be used to update the control value, \
	passing the desired SOC as an integer percentage from <code>0</code> - <code>100</code>.

energyCapacity.key = Energy Capacity
energyCapacity.desc = The total capacity of the battery, in <b>watt-hours</b>.

maxPowerRateCharge.key = Charge Max Power
maxPowerRateCharge.desc = The maximum power rate allowed for charging, in <b>watts</b>.

maxPowerRateDischarge.key = Discharge Max Power
maxPowerRateDischarge.desc = The maximum power rate allowed for discharging, in <b>watts</b>.

initialSoc.key = Start SOC
initialSoc.desc = The state of charge to use when the battery is first measured, as an \
	integer percentage from <code>0</code> - <code>100</code>.
