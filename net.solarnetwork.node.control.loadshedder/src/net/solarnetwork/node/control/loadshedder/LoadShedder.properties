loadShedderJob.loadShedderTrigger.key = Demand Balancer 
loadShedderJob.loadShedderTrigger.desc = Evaluate load (consumption) power and actively limit \
	it to stay below a certain threshold by controlling switches.

consumptionDataSource.propertyFilters['UID'].key = Meter Source
consumptionDataSource.propertyFilters['UID'].desc = The source ID of the energy meter to read power \
	load samples from.

powerCeilingWatts.key = Load Ceiling
powerCeilingWatts.desc = The desired absolute maximum power to limit the load to, in <b>watts</b>.

shedThresholdWatts.key = Shed Threshold
shedThresholdWatts.desc = The minimum power, in <b>watts</b>, before load will be actively limited.

configs.key = Rule List
configs.desc = A dynamic list of load switch configurations.

configsItem.active.key = Active
configsItem.active.desc = Toggle this rule on or off. Only active rules are evaluated when limiting \
	the load.

configsItem.controlId.key = Switch ID
configsItem.controlId.desc = The ID of the control that should handle load shed requests.

configsItem.name.key = Name
configsItem.name.desc = A descriptive name.

configsItem.priority.key = Priority
configsItem.priotiry.desc = The priority at which this rule should be evaluated against other rules. \
	<b>Lower</b> values are considered <b>more important</b>, so <code>1</code> has more importance than \
	<code>2</code>.

configsItem.timeWindowStart.key = Time Start
configsItem.timeWindowStart.desc = A time of day that active limiting must not occur before, \
