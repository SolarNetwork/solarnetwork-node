## Overall settings notes

 * **Source ID** â€” This value uniquely identifies the data collected from the feed, by this node,
   on SolarNetwork. Each configured feed should use a different value. Placeholder values are
   supported, including `{gridId}` and `{feedId}` placeholders that will be set to the values
   configured on the component.
