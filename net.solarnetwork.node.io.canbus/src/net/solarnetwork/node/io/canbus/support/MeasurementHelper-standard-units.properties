# UCUM standard units used in SolarNetwork
#
# Format is `std.N.S = U` where `N` is the count of base units, `S` is a unique
# symbol to distinguish between all units within the same base unit count, and `U`
# is the associated UCUM unit.

# Keep Cel rather than conver to K
std.0.Cel = Cel

std.2.Wh = W.h

# Alternate units used in SolarNetwork
#
# Format is `alt.S = U` where `S` is the alternate symbol and `U` is the parent
# UCUM unit.

alt.VA = W
alt.var = W
