title = Modbus Control

info.key = Status
info.desc = Current control value as modified in SolarNode. <b>Note</b> these values \
	might differ from the physical Modbus device, if an external process updates the \
	referenced register addresses, or SolarNode has not yet sampled the device values.

sample.key = Latest Reading
sample.desc = Overview of the latest reading from the device.

sourceId.key = Source ID
sourceId.desc = The source ID to assign to generated datum.

sampleCacheMs.key = Sample Maximum Age
sampleCacheMs.desc = The maximum number of milliseconds any sampled data may be cached \
	before refreshing it again from the device.

maxReadWordCount.key = Max Read Length
maxReadWordCount.desc = The maximum number of Modbus registers to read at once. This can \
	be used to work with Modbus devices that have trouble reading large ranges at once.

wordOrderKey.key = Word Order
wordOrderKey.desc = The register ordering for multi-register data types. Consult your Modbus \
	device's documentation on which to use.

propConfigs.key = Property Configurations
propConfigs.desc = A list of control property configurations that determine which controls \
	are connected to Modbus registers.
