title = SMA Driver (YASDI)

availableDevice.key = Available Device
availableDevice.desc = The name of a discovered device.
	
expectedDeviceCount.key = Expected device count
expectedDeviceCount.desc = The number of expected devices for a given device. Defaults to <b>1</b>. \
	Change requires restart of SolarNode.

driver.key = Driver
driver.desc = The YASDI driver name. Can be <b>libyasdi_drv_serial</b> or <b>libyasdi_drv_ip</b>.

device.key = Device
device.desc = For the serial driver, the port name, such as <b>/dev/ttyS0</b>. For the IP driver,\
	the IP address.
	
media.key = Media
media.desc = For the serial driver, the wiring type. Can be <b>Powerline</b>, <b>RS232</b>, or <b>RS485</b>.

baud.key = Baud
baud.desc = For the serial driver, the communication speed. For example <b>1200</b>. Inverters \
	should use <b>1200</b> while SunnyBoy Control uses <b>19200</b>.

protocol.key = Protocol
protocol.desc = The SMA communication protocol to use. Can be <b>SMANet</b> (the default) or \
	<b>SunnyNet</b>.

debugYasdi.key = Debug Mode
debugYasdi.desc = If enabled, then configure YASDI with debugging to STDERR. This \
	change will only take effect after SolarNode is restarted, and also requires \
	YASDI to have been compiled with debug support.
