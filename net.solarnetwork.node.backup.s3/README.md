# SolarNode S3 Backup Service

This project provides a cloud-based backup service to SolarNode.

![settings](docs/solarnode-s3-backup-settings.png)

# Configuration

The service supports the following settings:

| Setting    | Key             | Default            | Description                               |
|------------|-----------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| AWS Token  | accessToken     |                    | AWS access token for authentication.      |
| AWS Secret | accessSecret    |                    | AWS access token secret.                  |
| AWS Region | regionName      | us-west-2          | AWS service region.                       |
| S3 Bucket  | bucketName      |                    | S3 bucket name to save backups to.        |
| S3 Path    | objectKeyPrefix | solarnode-backups/ | A prefix to add to all backup data files. |

All values are required. The `S3 Path` value can be empty. The **Key** values
are Configuration Admin keys for the `net.solarnetwork.node.backup.s3.S3BackupService`
PID. That means you can configure these in a 
`conf/services/net.solarnetwork.node.backup.s3.S3BackupService.cfg` file on the
node if you don't want to manage them via the Setup GUI. For example:

```
# Sample conf/services/net.solarnetwork.node.backup.s3.S3BackupService.cfg file

accessToken = 123abc
accessSecret = 234bcd
regionName = us-east-1
bucketName = mybucket
```

# S3 Structure

Backups are stored using a **shared** object structure, where individual backup
resources are named after the SHA256 digest of their content with a
`backup-data/` prefix added. Metadata about each backup (for example a
listing of the resources included in the backup) is then stored as an
object named with the node ID and backup timestamp with a `backup-meta/` prefix
added.

Here's a an example listing of the objects stored in S3 after a couple of
backups have finished:

![objects](docs/solarnode-s3-backup-objects.png)

The **shared** aspect of the backups means that individual `backup-data/`
objects can be referenced by multiple backups. Once a resource is backed
up to S3, it won't be uploaded to S3 again in future backups unless the
resource changes.

The **shared** aspect of the backups also means that multiple _nodes_ can
be configured to save backup data to the same S3 location. In that
situation the same resources across the nodes will only be stored once
in `backup-data/`, and referenced by their respective backup metadata.

# Metadata Structure

The backup metadata is a JSON document that defines some general information
about the backup along with a list of all resources included in the backup. Each
resource contains a SolarNode-specific `providerKey` representing the provider
of the resource, a `backupPath` defined by that provider, and an `objectKey`
that points to the S3 object that contains the data for that resource.
