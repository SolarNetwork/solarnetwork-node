title = GPIO Control Property Configuration

controlId.key = Control ID
controlId.desc = The ID to use for the SolarNode control. This should be unique amongst all control IDs \
	deployed on the SolarNode. By convention, control IDs are grouped into a hierarchy via slash characters, \
	for example <code>/gpio/1</code>.

address.key = GPIO Address
address.desc = The GPIO address. Addresses start at <code>0</code>.

gpioDirectionCode.key = GPIO Direction
gpioDirectionCode.desc = The I/O direction of the GPIO address.

gpioEdgeModeCode.key = GPIO Edge Mode
gpioEdgeModeCode.desc = When to report changes in digital IO lines. Rising is when the voltage changes from \
	low to high; Falling is the opposite.
