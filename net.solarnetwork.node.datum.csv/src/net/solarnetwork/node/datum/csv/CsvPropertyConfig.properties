title = CSV Property Configuration

column.key = Column
column.desc = A list of 1- or letter-based CSV column references to read. Can be specified either as \
	1-based integers or spreadsheet-style letters like <code>A</code>. If multiple columns are configured, \
	they will be joined with a space character to form the final datum property value.

slope.key = Multiplier
slope.desc = A multiplication factor to apply to number values to \
	normalize the value into a standard unit. For example <code>1000</code> would convert \
	a <i>killowatts</i> CSV value into <i>watts</i>.
	
intercept.key = Offset
intercept.desc = A value to add to number values to normalize the value into a standard unit. \
	For example <code>-5</code> would subtract 5 from the CSV value.

decimalScale.key = Decimal Scale
decimalScale.desc = A maximum scale (number of digits after the decimal point) to \
	round decimal values to. Set to <code>0</code> \
	to round to whole numbers. Set to <code>-1</code> to disable rounding.
