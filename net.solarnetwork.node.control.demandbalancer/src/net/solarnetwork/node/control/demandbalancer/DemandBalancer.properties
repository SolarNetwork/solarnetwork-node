title = Demand Balancer

triggerCronExpression.key = Schedule
triggerCronExpression.desc = A \
	<a href="{0}">\
	cron expression</a> representing the schedule to execute the heartbeat at.

demandBalancerJob.demandBalancerTrigger.key = Demand Balancer 
demandBalancerJob.demandBalancerTrigger.desc = Evaluate demand (consumption) power and generation power \
	and limit generation to no more than the demand.

balanceStrategy.propertyFilters['UID'].key = Balance Strategy
balanceStrategy.propertyFilters['UID'].desc = The name of a deployed <b>Balance Strategy</b> \
	to use for deciding how to respond to demand and generation conditions. If not configured a default \
	strategy will be used.

consumptionDataSource.propertyFilters['UID'].key = Consumption Component
consumptionDataSource.propertyFilters['UID'].desc = The <em>Service Name</em> of the consumption data source \
	to use for collecting current consumption levels from.

consumptionDataSource.propertyFilters['groupUID'].key = Consumption Group
consumptionDataSource.propertyFilters['groupUID'].desc = The <em>Service Group</em> of a collection of \
	consumption data sources to use for collecting current consumption levels from. If this is configured, \
	this value <em>and</em> the configured <b>Consumption Component</b> will be used to determine which \
	data sources to use. To use all sources within a group, leave <b>Consumption Component</b> empty.

acEnergyPhaseFilter.key = Phase Filter
acEnergyPhaseFilter.desc = A comma-delimited set of <code>ACPhase</code> values to limit the demand \
	calculation to using, when available. The possible values are: \
	<code>PhaseA</code>, <code>PhaseB</code>, <code>PhaseC</code>, and <code>Total</code>.

powerDataSource.propertyFilters['UID'].key = Generation Component
powerDataSource.propertyFilters['UID'].desc = The <em>Service Name</em> of the generation data source \
	to use for collecting current generation levels from.

powerDataSource.propertyFilters['groupUID'].key = Generation Group
powerDataSource.propertyFilters['groupUID'].desc = The <em>Service Group</em> of a collection of \
	generation data sources to use for collecting current generation levels from. If this is configured, \
	this value <em>and</em> the configured <b>Generation Component</b> will be used to determine which \
	data sources to use. To use all sources within a group, leave <b>Generation Component</b> empty.

powerControlId.key = Limit Control
powerControlId.desc = The ID of the control to both read and set the desired generation limit on. \
	This control is expected to report and accept an <em>integer percentage</em> value (0 - 100).

powerMaximumWatts.key = Generation Capacity
powerMaximumWatts.desc = The maximum overall capacity in <b>watts</b> of the configured Generation \
	Component(s). This value is used to determine what generation limit is appropriate for the demand \
	conditions.

collectPower.key = Need Generation
collectPower.desc = If the configured <em>Balance Strategy</em> does not need the current power \
	generation data to make its decisions, then turning this off can speed up the execution of \
	this service as it will no longer collect generation data from any generation data sources.
