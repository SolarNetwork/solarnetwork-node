unknownDemandLimit.key = Unknown Demand Limit Percent
unknownDemandLimit.desc = If the demand is unknown, for example from being unable to read the \
	current demand conditions from devices, force the limit to this value (an integer from 0-100). \
	Set to <code>-1</code> to not force any change (and leave the current limit unchanged).
