title = Mock GPSd Connection
desc = Provides a simulated connection to a <code>gpsd</code> server for other plugins to use.

updatePeriodMs.key = Frequency
updatePeriodMs.desc = The frequency at which to generate GPSd TPV report messages, in milliseconds.

elevation.key = Elevation
elevation.desc = The base elevation to report.

latitude.key = Latitude
latitude.desc = The base latitude to report.

longitude.key = Longitude
longitude.desc = The base longitude to report.

elevationVariation.key = Elevation Variation
elevationVariation.desc = An amount of random variation to apply to elevation readings, in meters. Set to <code>0</code> to disable.

latitudeVariation.key = Latitude Variation
latitudeVariation.desc = An amount of random variation to apply to latitude readings, in meters. Set to <code>0</code> to disable.

longitudeVariation.key = Longitude Variation
