controlId.key = Control ID
controlId.desc = The ID to use for the SolarNode control. This should be unique amongst all control IDs \

	for example <code>/gpio/1</code>.

address.key = Address
address.desc = The GPIO address. Addresses start at <code>0</code>.

gpioTypeCode.key = GPIO Type
gpioTypeCode.desc = The type of GPIO used.
