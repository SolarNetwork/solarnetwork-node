# SolarNode Time-based Tariff Datum Support

This project provides a SolarNode plugin that provides some components that can
be used to work with datum stream-based tariff schedules. For more information, see the individual
component documentation:

 * [Time-based Tariff Datum Source](README-DatumSource.md) - generate a datum stream from a
   time-based tariff schedule
 * [Time-based Tariff Schedule - SolarNetwork](README-SolarNetwork.md) - generate a tariff schedule
   by querying a datum stream in SolarNetwork
