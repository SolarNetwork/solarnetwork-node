title = Time-based Tariff Datum Source
desc = This component provides a way to generate a datum stream from a time-of-use tariff schedule.

sourceId.key = Source ID
sourceId.desc = A unique source identifier.

status.key = Status
status.desc = Brief status on the filter.

rules.empty = No rules.
cached.valid = Schedule cached at {0}; expires at {1}.
cached.invalid = Schedule cached at {0}; expired at {1}.
rates.active = Active rates (calculated at {0}):
schedule.none = No schedule available.

metadataServiceUid.key = Metadata Service
metadataServiceUid.desc = The <b>Service Name</b> of the <i>Metadata Service</i> to obtain the tariff schedule from.

metadataPath.key = Metadata Path
metadataPath.desc = The metadata path that will resolve the tariff schedule from the configured \
	Metadata Service. For example: <code>/pm/tariffs/my-schedule</code>.

language.key = Language
language.desc = A language to parse the tariff data with. If not configured then the default system \
	language will be assumed.

firstMatchOnly.key = First Match
firstMatchOnly.desc = If enabled, then apply only the <b>first</b> tariff that matches a given datum date. \
	If disabled, then apply <b>all</b> tariffs that match.

preserveRateCase.key = Preserve Case
preserveRateCase.desc = If enabled, then preserve the case of the tariff rate names extracted from the \
	CSV header row. Otherwise the names will be converted to all lower-case.

scheduleCacheTtlSecs.key = Schedule Cache
scheduleCacheTtlSecs.desc = The amount of <b>seconds</b> to cache the tariff schedule obtained from the configured \
	<i>Metadata Service</i>.

evaluatorUid.key = Tariff Evaluator
evaluatorUid.desc = The <b>Service Name</b> of a <i>Time-based Tariff Evaluator</i> service to evaluate \
	each tariff to determine if it should apply to a given datum. If not configured a default \
	algorithm is used that matches all non-empty constraints in an inclusive manner, except \
	for the time-of-day constraint which uses an exclusive upper bound.

propertyConfigs.key = Properties
propertyConfigs.desc = A list of datum property configurations for capturing rate values.
