controlId.key = Control ID
controlId.desc = The ID to use for the SolarNode control. This should be unique amongst all control IDs \
	deployed on the SolarNode. By convention, control IDs are grouped into a hierarchy via slash characters, \
	for example <code>/relay/1</code>.

identity.key = Identity
identity.desc = The identity of the relay to manage. This defaults to <code>160</code> (<code>0xA0</code>) and \
	probably does not need changing.

address.key = Address
address.desc = The relay address to manage. Addresses start at <code>1</code> and increase for each relay available \
	on the device.
