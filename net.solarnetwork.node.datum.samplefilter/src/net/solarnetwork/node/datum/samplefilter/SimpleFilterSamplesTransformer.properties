title = Datum Property Filter
desc = This component provides a way to limit which <b>properties</b> of datum are uploaded \
	to SolarNetwork. This can help if some component generates properties that you don't \
	actually need to use.

propIncludes.key = Property Includes
propIncludes.desc = A list of  case-insensitive property name regular expressions to match against \
	sample property names. If configured, <b>only</b> properties that match one of these expressions \
	will be included in the filtered output. For example <code>^watt</code> would match any \
	property starting with <b>watt</b>.

propIncludesItem.name.key = Property
propIncludesItem.name.desc = A case-insensitive property name regular expression to match against \
	sample property names.

propIncludesItem.frequency.key = Limit Seconds
propIncludesItem.frequency.desc = The minimum number of seconds to limit properties that match the configured \
	property name pattern. If properties are produced faster than this rate, they will be \
	filtered out. Leave empty (or <code>0</code>) for no limit.

excludes.key = Property Excludes
excludes.desc = A list of  case-insensitive property name regular expressions to match against \
	sample property names. If configured, <b>any</b> property that match one of these expressions \
	will be excluded from the filtered output. For example <code>^temp</code> would match any \
	property starting with <b>temp</b>. Exclusions are applied <b>after</b> property inclusions.

excludesItem.key = {0}
