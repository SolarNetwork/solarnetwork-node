title = Datum Throttle Filter
desc = This component provides a way to limit the rate at which datum are uploaded \
	to SolarNetwork, at the <b>source</b> level. This can help if some component \
	generates datum for multiple sources, but some sources do not need to be uploaded \
	as much as others.

uid.key = Filter ID
uid.desc = A unique name to distinguish between multiple filters.

frequencySeconds.key = Limit Seconds
frequencySeconds.desc = The minimum number of seconds to limit datum that match the configured \
	<code>sourceId</code> pattern. If datum are processed faster than this rate, they will be \
	filtered out.
