/**
 * API for a configuration object.
 * 
 * <p>This API can be used to publish configuration information from one OSGi
 * bundle to another, without knowing the actual implementation of any 
 * target service. For example, imagine two serial IO implementation bundles
 * exist, but the SolarNode application does not know which one the user
 * will choose to use. In this case, the SolarNode application bundle need
 * not import either of the IO implementation bundles directly. Instead it
 * can publish a {@code BeanConfiguration} service that the IO implementations
 * can register to use to configure itself.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The {@link BeanConfigurationServiceRegistrationListener} provides an
 * easy way for implementation bundles to bind to {@link BeanConfiguration}
 * services at runtime and dynamically publish services based on this
 * configuration.</p>
