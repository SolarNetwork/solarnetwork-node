serialPort.key = Serial port
serialPort.desc = The device port name. This varies by operating system. Some examples \
	are <code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code> and <code>COM1</code>.

commPortAppName.key = Serial port application name
commPortAppName.desc = A unique name to distinguish use of this client on a given serial port \
	from other clients within the application using the same port. Sharing a serial port for \
	multiple clients is not common, however. 

maxWait.key = Response timeout
maxWait.desc = The maximum number of milliseconds to wait for a response.
	
baud.key = Baud
dataBits.key = Data bits
stopBits.key = Stop bits
parity.key = Parity
flowControl.key = Flow control
receiveThreshold.key = Receive threshold
receiveTimeout.key = Receive timeout
receiveFraming.key = Receive framing
dtrFlag.key = DTR
rtsFlag.key = RTS

baud.desc = The maximum communication speed to use.
dataBits.desc = The number of data bits per message.
stopBits.desc = The number of stop bits per message.
parity.desc = Parity
flowControl.desc = Flow control
receiveThreshold.desc = Receive threshold
receiveTimeout.desc = Receive timeout
receiveFraming.desc = Receive framing
dtrFlag.desc = The SerialPort DTR setting to setup communication with. When set \
	to <b>0<b> DTR will be set to <em>false</em>. When set to <b>1</b> \
	DTR will be set to <em>true</em>. When configured as less than zero \
	the DTR setting will not be changed.
rtsFlag.desc = The SerialPort RTS setting to setup communication with. When set \
	to <b>0<b> RTS will be set to <em>false</em>. When set to <b>1</b> \
	RTS will be set to <em>true</em>. When configured as less than zero \
	the RTS setting will not be changed.
