title = Datum Queue
desc = A central queue for processing captured datum locally and sequentially by datum date. \
	You can configure a datum filter on the queue, which is applied to <b>all</b> datum before \
	any other global or user filters. This can be useful for some filters like the Virtual Meter \
	Filter which need to process datum in order by date.

status.key = Status
status.desc = Overview statistics on the number of datum processed since SolarNode started.
status.msg = <div class="row"><div class="span5">\
	<table class="table table-condensed table-striped counts"><tbody>\
	<tr><th>Added</th><td>{0}</td></tr>\
	<tr><th>Captured</th><td>{1}</td></tr>\
	<tr><th>Processed</th><td>{2}</td></tr>\
	<tr><th>Duplicates</th><td>{3}</td></tr>\
	<tr><th>Filtered</th><td>{4}</td></tr>\
	<tr><th>Persisted</th><td>{5}</td></tr>\
	<tr><th>Errors</th><td>{6}</td></tr>\
	<tr><th>Processing time</th><td>{7}</td></tr>\
	<tr><th>Persistence time</th><td>{8}</td></tr>\
	<tr><th>Average time / datum</th><td>{9}</td></tr>\
	<tr><th>Average persistence time / datum</th><td>{10}</td></tr>\
	</tbody></table>\

queueDelayMs.key = Delay
queueDelayMs.desc = A delay, in milliseconds, before processing datum events. This delay can help ensure \
	datum are processed sequentially by time in highly concurrent environments. Setting to \
	<code>0</code> disables the delay.
	
transformServiceUid.key = Datum Filter
transformServiceUid.desc = The <b>Service Name</b> of a Datum Filter component to process datum with. \
	Can be a the UID of a specific Datum Filter or a Datum Filter Chain.

discardDatumOnFilterException.key = Discard On Filter Error
