serialPort.key = Serial port
serialPort.desc = The device port name. This varies by operating system. Some examples \
	are <code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code> and <code>COM1</code>.

commPortAppName.key = Serial port application name
commPortAppName.desc = A unique name to distinguish use of this client on a given serial port \
	from other clients within the application using the same port. Sharing a serial port for \
	multiple clients is not common, however. 

maxWait.key = Response timeout
maxWait.desc = The maximum number of milliseconds to wait for a response before giving up. \
	This differs from the <em>Receive timeout</em> setting in that this is not a timeout \
	controlled by the serial port, rather the application enforces it. If set to <b>0</b> \
	or less the timeout is disabled and the application will wait indefinitely for responses.
	
baud.key = Baud
baud.desc = The maximum communication speed to use.

dataBits.key = Data bits
dataBits.desc = The number of data bits per message.

stopBits.key = Stop bits
stopBits.desc = The number of stop bits per message. The valid values are:\
	<dl><dt>1</dt><dd>1</dd><dt>2</dt><dd>2</dd><dt>3</dt><dd>1.5</dd></dl>
	
parity.key = Parity
parity.desc = The serial port parity setting to use. The valid values are: \
	<dl><dt>0</dt><dd>None</dd><dt>1</dt><dd>Odd</dd><dt>2</dt><dd>Even</dd>\
	<dt>3</dt><dd>Mark</dd><dt>4</dt><dd>Space</dd></dl>

flowControl.key = Flow control
flowControl.desc = The serial port flow control setting to use. The valid values are: \
	<dl><dt>0</dt><dd>None</dd><dt>1</dt><dd>RTS CTS in</dd><dt>2</dt><dd>RTS CTS out</dd>\
	<dt>4</dt><dd>XON XOFF in</dd><dt>8</dt><dd>XON XOFF out</dd></dl>

receiveThreshold.key = Receive threshold
receiveThreshold.desc = The serial port receive threshold setting. If \
	set to anything less than <b>0</b> then the receive threshold will be disabled.
	
receiveTimeout.key = Receive timeout
receiveTimeout.desc = The serial port receive timeout setting. If \
	set to anything less than <b>0</b> then the receive timeout will be disabled.
	
receiveFraming.key = Receive framing
receiveFraming.desc = The serial port receive framing setting to use. If \
	set to anything less than <b>0</b> then the receive threshold will be disabled.

dtrFlag.key = DTR
dtrFlag.desc = The serial port DTR setting to setup communication with. When set \
	to <b>0</b> DTR will be set to <em>false</em>. When set to <b>1</b> \
	DTR will be set to <em>true</em>. When configured as less than zero \
	the DTR setting will not be changed.

rtsFlag.key = RTS
rtsFlag.desc = The serial port RTS setting to setup communication with. When set \
	to <b>0</b> RTS will be set to <em>false</em>. When set to <b>1</b> \
	RTS will be set to <em>true</em>. When configured as less than zero \
	the RTS setting will not be changed.
