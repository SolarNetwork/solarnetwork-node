# SolarNode BACnet Control

This project provides SolarNode plugin that can be used to set BACnet object property values, such
as numbers or strings, via the SolarNode Control API. This is an advanced plugin that requires
knowledge of BACnet and the BACnet configuration of the components you want to control.

![settings](docs/solarnode-bacnet-control-settings.png)

# Use

Once installed, a new **BACnet Control** component will appear on the **Settings** page on your
SolarNode. Click on the **Manage** button to configure components. Each component can be configured
with any number of updatable _controls_, each with a unique _control ID_.  Each control is
configured to write to a specific BACnet object property on a BACnet device.

For example you might define a `therm/setpoint/1` control
that writes a temperature value as a floating point value to a BACnet object property.

A status indicator will appear at the top of the device settings, which will display the latest
readings obtained from the configured BACnet registers.

# CSV Configurer

This plugin provides a **BACnet Control CSV Configurer** component will appear on the main settings
page. This component lets you upload a BACnet Control CSV Configuration file to configure all BACnet
Control components, without having to use the component settings form.

![CSV Configurer settings](docs/solarnode-bacnet-control-csv-configurer-settings.png)

## BACnet Control CSV Configuration Format

The BACnet Control CSV Configuration uses the column structure detailed
[below](#csv-column-definition), with each row representing an individual control to write to the
BACnet device. A header row is required. Comment lines are allowed, just start the line with a `#`
character (i.e. the first cell value). The entire comment line will be ignored.

Here's an example screen shot of a configuration in a spreadsheet application. It is for two components:

 1. Component `Therm` with 3 controls: `term/setpoint/1`, `term/setpoint/1`, `term/away`
 2. Component `Relay` with 1 control: `switch/1`

Spreadsheet applications generally allows you to export the sheet in the CSV format, which can
then be loaded into SolarNode via the CSV Configurer.

![CSV Configuration example](docs/solarnode-bacnet-control-csv-configurer-example.png)

### Instance identifiers

Individual BACnet Control components are defined by the first column (**Instance ID**). You can
assign any identifier you like (such as `Relay`, `PLC`, and so on) or configure as a single
dash character `-` to have SolarNode assign a simple number identifier. Once an Instance ID has been
assigned on a given row, subsequent rows will use that value if the corresponding cell value is left
empty.

Here is an example of how 2 custom instance IDs `Relay` and `Term` appear in the SolarNode UI:

![BACnet Control instance names](docs/solarnode-bacnet-control-instance-keys.png)

### CSV column definition

The following table defines all the CSV columns used by BACnet Control CSV Configuration. Columns
**A - E** apply to the **entire BACnet Control configuration**, and only the values from the row that
defines a new Instance ID will be used to configure the device. Thus you can omit the values from
these columns when defining more than one property for a given device.

Columns **I - Q** define the mapping of BACnet registers to datum properties: each row defines an
individual datum property.


| Col | Name | Type | Default | Description |
|:----|:-----|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| `A` | **Instance ID** | string |  | The unique identifier for a single BACnet Control component. Can specify `-` to automatically assign a simple number value, which will start at `1`. |
| `B` | **Service Name** | string |  | An optional service name to assign to the component. |
| `C` | **Service Group** | string |  | An optional service group to assign to the component. |
| `D` | **Connection** | string | `BACnet Port` | The **service name** of the BACnet connection to use. |
| `E` | **Sample Cache** | integer | `5000` | A minimum time to cache captured BACnet data, in milliseconds. |
| `F` | **Control ID** | string |  | The node-unique identifier for the control. |
| `G` | **Property Type** | enum | `Boolean` |  The type of control property to use. Must be one of `Boolean`, `Float`, `Integer`, `Percent`, or `String`, and can be shortened to just `b`, `f`, `i`, `p`, or `s`. |
| `H` | **Device ID** | integer |  | The BACnet device ID to update. |
| `I` | **Object Type** | string |  | The BACnet object type to update. Can be specified as a name, like <code>analog-value</code> or <code>AnalogValue</code>, or the associated integer code, like <code>2</code>. |
| `J` | **Object Number** | integer |  | The BACnet object type instance number to update. |
| `K` | **Property ID** | string | `present-value` | The BACnet object property identifier to update. Can be specified as a name, like <code>present-value</code> or <code>PresentValue</code>, or the associated integer code, like <code>85</code>. |
| `L` | **Multiplier** | decimal | `1` | For numeric data types, a multiplier to apply to the BACnet value to normalize it into a standard unit. |
| `M` | **Decimal Scale** | integer | `0` | For numeric data types, a maximum number of decimal places to round decimal numbers to, or `-1` to not do any rounding. |

# Overall settings

Each component configuration contains the following settings:

| Setting                 | Description |
|:------------------------|:------------|
| Service Name            | An optional unique name to identify this component with. |
| Service Group           | An optional group name to associate this component with. |
| BACnet Connection       | The **Service Name** of the **BACnet Connection** component to use. |
| Sample Maximum Age      | A maximum time to cache captured BACnet data, in milliseconds. |
| Property Configurations | A list of BACnet object property-specific settings. Any number of property configurations can be added, to update any number of BACnet device object properties. |


## Overall settings notes

<dl>
	<dt>BACnet Connection</dt>
	<dd>This is the <b>Service Name</b> of the <b>BACnet Connection</b> component configured elsewhere
	in SolarNode. You must configure that component with the proper connection settings
	for your BACnet network, configure a unique Service Name on that component, and then
	enter that same Service Name  here.</dd>
	<dt>Sample Maximum Age</dt>
	<dd>SolarNode will cache the data collected from the BACnet device for at most
	this amount of time before refreshing data from the device again. Some devices
	do not refresh their values more than a fixed interval, so this setting can be
	used to avoid reading data unnecessarily. This setting also helps in highly
	dynamic configurations where other plugins request the current values from
	this component frequently.</dd>
</dl>

# Property settings

You must configure settings for each BACnet object property you want to expose as an updatable
control. You can configure as many property settings as you like, using the <kbd>+</kbd> and
<kbd>-</kbd> buttons to add/remove configurations.

![Property settings](docs/solarnode-bacnet-control-property-settings.png)

Each property configuration contains the following settings:

| Setting         | Default | Description |
|:----------------|:--------|:------------|
| Control ID      |  | A unique name to associate this control configuration with. |
| Property Type   | `Boolean` | The SolarNode control property type. Must be one of `Boolean`, `Float`, `Integer`, `Percent`, or `String`. |
| Object Type     |  | The BACnet object type to update. Can be specified as a name, like <code>analog-value</code> or <code>AnalogValue</code>, or the associated integer code, like <code>2</code>. |
| Object Number   |  | The BACnet object type instance number to update. |
| Property ID     | `present-value` | The BACnet object property identifier to update. Can be specified as a name, like <code>present-value</code> or <code>PresentValue</code>, or the associated integer code, like <code>85</code>. |
| Multiplier      | `1` | For numeric data types, a multiplier to apply to the BACnet property value to normalize it into a standard unit. |
| Decimal Scale   | `5` | For numeric data types, a maximum number of decimal places to round decimal numbers to, or `-1` to not do any rounding. |

## Property settings notes

<dl>
	<dt>Control ID</dt>
	<dd>This should be unique amongst all control IDs deployed on the SolarNode. By convention,
	control IDs are grouped into a hierarchy via slash characters, for example
	<code>therm/setpoint/1</code>. This ID will also be used as the datum source ID if the control
	value is posted to SolarNetwork.</dd>
	<dt>Property Type</dt>
	<dd>Each property must be categorized as <code>Boolean</code> (on/off), <code>Float</code>
	(decimal number), <code>Integer</code> (whole number), <code>Percent</code> (decimal
	number between 0 and 1), or <code>String</code>.</dd>
	<dt>Multiplier</dt>
	<dd>The property values stored in SolarNetwork should be normalized into standard
	base units if possible. For example if a power meter reports power in <i>kilowattts</i>
	then a unit multiplier of <code>1000</code> can be used to convert the values into
	<i>watts</i>. When writing values to BACnet, the value will be <i>divided</i> by this
	amount first.</dd>
	<dt>Decimal Scale</dt>
	<dd>This setting will round decimal numbers to at most this number of decimal places. Setting
	to <code>0</code> rounds decimals to whole numbers. Setting to <code>-1</code> disables
	rounding completely.</dd>
</dl>

# Control manipulation

Once configured each control can be changed on the node itself or via the SolarNetwork API.

## Local SolarNode control

You can set a control value using the SolarNode GUI once the device is configured. Visit the
**Controls** page, then tap the **Manage** button for the control ID of the switch you want to
toggle. You'll see a form where you can enter the desired value, like this:

![SolarNode Controls UI](docs/solarnode-bacnet-control-ui.png)

## SolarNetwork control

The [SolarUser Instruction API][instr-api] can be used to change the control from anywhere in the
world, by requesting the SolarNode to perform a [`SetControlParameter`][SetControlParameter]
instruction and passing a single instruction parameter named the **Control ID** you configured for
the control and the desired value as the parameter value.

For example, to set the `therm/setpoint/1` control to `29.0` an HTTP `POST` like this would update
the value:

```
POST /solaruser/api/v1/sec/instr/add/SetControlParameter

{"nodeId":123,"params":{"therm/setpoint/1":"29.0"}}
```
