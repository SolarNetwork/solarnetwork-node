title = Web Proxy
desc = This component allows you to configure an HTTP proxy from this node to another web server. \
	This can be especially useful when using SolarSSH to access a node, so you can then access \
	another web-based application on the same local network as the node.

proxyTargetUri.key = Target URL
proxyTargetUri.desc = The absolute URL to the HTTP service to proxy, e.g. <code>http://192.168.1.2:8888</code>.

proxyPath.key = Proxy Name
proxyPath.desc = An optional, unique name to use in the proxy URL. This can be used to define an easy-to-remember \
	URL for the proxy service.

contentLinksRewrite.key = Link Rewrite
contentLinksRewrite.desc = If enabled, rewrite URL links in appropriate response body content to work with the proxy.
