trigger.cronExpression.key = Schedule
trigger.cronExpression.desc = A \
	<a href="http://quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-1.x/tutorials/crontrigger">\
	cron expression</a> representing the schedule to sample data at.

mockMeterDatumLoggerJob.mockMeterDatumLoggerTrigger.key = Mock Power Meter Logger 
mockMeterDatumLoggerJob.mockMeterDatumLoggerTrigger.desc = Capture mock meter data \
	and cache the data on this SolarNode.

info.key = Status
info.desc = Information on the last meter sample and any load shed amounts.

uid.key = Source ID
uid.desc = A unique name to identify this meter with.

groupUID.key = Service Group
groupUID.desc = An optional group to include this service in.

watts.key = Watts
watts.desc = Approximate power draw to simulate when not charging.

wattsRandomness.key = Watts Randomness
wattsRandomness.desc = A randomness factor to apply to the power draw when not charging.

loadShedControlPowerMappingValue.key = Load Shed Controls
loadShedControlPowerMappingValue.desc = A mapping of control IDs to watt values, to simulate \
	load shed events. If a boolean control value changes for one of the mapped IDs, the associated watts \
	will be added to or subtracted from the simulated load. The syntax is <code>controlId = watts, ...</code>.
