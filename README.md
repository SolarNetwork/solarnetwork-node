# SolarNode - the distributed SolarNetwork platform

SolarNode is the platform for the distributed component of [SolarNetwork][sn]. It is
mainly responsible for:

 * collecting data from devices and posting it to SolarNetwork
 * handling instructions from SolarNetwork, and posting the results back to SolarNetwork

SolarNode is designed to be deployed on low-power devices that have some sort of network
connectivity.

To get started, please see the [SolarNetwork Developer Guide][dev-guide].
