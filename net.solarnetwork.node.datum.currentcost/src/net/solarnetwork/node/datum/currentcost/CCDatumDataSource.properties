addressSourceMappingValue.key = Address mapping
addressSourceMappingValue.desc = A key/value mapping of CurrentCost addresses to \
	<code>sourceId</code> values. This can be used to consistently collect \
	data from CurrentCosts, even after the CurrentCost has been reset and \
	it generates a new random address ID value for itself. The syntax is like \
	<b>addr.X = sourceId, addr2.X = sourceId2, ...</b>, where <code>X</code> is \
	either an amp sensor index (1 - 3) or <code>T</code> to capture the temperature.
