trigger.cronExpression.key = Schedule
trigger.cronExpression.desc = A \
	<a href="http://quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-1.x/tutorials/crontrigger">\
	cron expression</a> representing the schedule to sample data at.

ccDatumLoggerJob.ccDatumLoggerTrigger.key = CurrentCost Logger 
ccDatumLoggerJob.ccDatumLoggerTrigger.desc = Sample data from the CurrentCost monitors and cache the data on the node.

addressSourceMappingValue.key = Address mapping
addressSourceMappingValue.desc = A key/value mapping of CurrentCost addresses to \
	<code>sourceId</code> values. This can be used to consistently collect \
	data from CurrentCosts, even after the CurrentCost has been reset and \
	it generates a new random address ID value for itself. The syntax is like \
	<b>addr.X = sourceId, addr2.X = sourceId2, ...</b>, where <code>X</code> is \
	either an amp sensor index (1 - 3) or <code>T</code> to capture the temperature.
