title = SMA Power Control Module

connectionFactory.propertyFilters['UID'].key = Modbus serial port
connectionFactory.propertyFilters['UID'].desc = The Modbus serial port to use for communicating with the PCM.

controlId.key = Control ID
controlId.desc = The ID to use for the PCM SolarNode control. This should be unique amongst all control IDs \
	deployed on the SolarNode. By convention, control IDs are grouped into a hierarchy via slash characters, \
	for example <code>/power/pcm/1</code>. This control uses an integer value from 0-15, representing the \
	limit levels the PCM supports. A secondary control will automatically be exposed whose ID is this value \
	appended with <code>?percent</code>, for example <code>/power/pcm/1?percent</code>. That control uses \
	an integer percentage value from 0 - 100 to represent the limit level.

groupUID.key = Service Group
groupUID.desc = An optional group to include this service in.

d1Address.key = D1 Address
d1Address.desc = The modbus address for the D1 digital input.

d2Address.key = D2 Address
d2Address.desc = The modbus address for the D2 digital input.

d3Address.key = D3 Address
d3Address.desc = The modbus address for the D3 digital input.

d4Address.key = D4 Address
d4Address.desc = The modbus address for the D4 digital input.

unitId.key = Modbus Unit ID
unitId.desc = The Modbus ID to use when communicating with the digital inputs.

status.key = Status
status.desc = The status of the PCM. The inputs are shown in <b>descending order</b> D4 to D1, \
	with <code>1</code> for <i>closed</i> and <code>0</code> for <i>open</i>. The approximate \
	output percentage is shown as well.
