SolarNetwork aims to foster awareness of energy use and stimulate ideas on both reducing energy waste and increasing energy efficiency. SolarNetwork does not collect data other than that explicitly added to SolarNetwork. By default data added to SolarNetwork will be publicly available at anonymous, aggregated levels of detail. This can be disabled if desired by changing your settings to &quot;Private&quot; mode. At this time &quot;Private&quot; nodes are free but this will likely change in the future."><networkServiceURLs>
