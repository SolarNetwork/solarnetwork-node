title = New Zealand Metservice weather information

baseUrl.key = Base URL
timestampDateFormat.key = Timestamp format
oneMinObs.key = One minute observation file
localObs.key = Local observation file
uv.key = UV index file
localForecast.key = Local forecast name
localForecastDayPattern.key = Day date format

baseUrl.desc = The base URL for queries to Metservice.
timestampDateFormat.desc = A date and time pattern for parsing the information date from \
	the <em>oneMinObs</em> file. The syntax is from \
	the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html">java.text.SimpleDateFormat</a> \
	specification.
oneMinObs.desc = The name of the <em>oneMinObs</em> file to parse. This file is expected \
	to contain a single JSON object declaration with the temperature, timestamp, etc. attributes.
localObs.desc = The name of the <em>localObs</em> file to parse. This file is expected \
	to contain a single JSON object declaration with the humidity, pressure, etc. attributes.
uv.desc = The name of the <em>uv</em> file to parse. This file is expected \
	to contain a single JSON object declaration with the UV attribute.
localForecast.desc = The name of the <em>localForecast</em> file to parse. This file is expected \
	to contain a single JSON object declaration with an array of day JSON objects, \
	the first day from which the sky conditions are extracted. The real-time \
	data doesn't provide sky conditions, so we just use the presumably static \
	value for the day.
localForecastDayPattern.desc = A regular expression used to extract a single day JSON object from \
	the <em>localForecast</em> file. This service doesn't perform actual JSON \
	parsing, and can only work with simple JSON objects. This regular \
	expression must include a single matching group that returns the \
	appropriate day object from the overall <em>localForecast</em> data.
