title = SolarIn/HTTP Upload Service
desc = Service to upload locally cached datum to SolarNetwork in batch. When SolarIn/MQTT is configured \
	then only when that connection is down will any datum get cached locally. Control how frequently \
	data is uploaded by changing the <b>Bulk Datum Upload</b> schedule.

uploadEmptyDataset.key = Always Upload
uploadEmptyDataset.desc = Always make an upload request, even if there isn't any data to upload. \
	This can be useful when you'd like to be able to receive instructions consistently. It is typically not \
	necessary when SolarIn/MQTT is configured.
