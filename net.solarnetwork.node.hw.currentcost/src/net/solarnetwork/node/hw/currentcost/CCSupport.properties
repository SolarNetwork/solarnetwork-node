knownAddresses.key = Seen Devices
knownAddresses.desc = Displays a list of CurrentCost device addresses that have been \
	seen so far. You can use this to help configure the address mapping settings.

voltage.key = Voltage
voltage.desc = The fixed voltage to use to measure current. CurrentCosts measure only \
	watts, so a fixed voltage is configured to generate an approximate current.

multiAmpSensorIndexFlags.key = Amp sensor mask
multiAmpSensorIndexFlags.desc = A CurrentCost supports up to 3 current sensors. This setting \
	is a bitmask flag specifying which sensors to collect readings from. The amp sensors number \
	<b>1 - 3</b>. Enable reading each index by adding together each index as \
	<code>2 ^ (index - 1)</code>. Thus to read from sensor 1 configure this as <b>1</b>. To \
	read from all 3 sensors set this value to <b>7</b> (<code>2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2) = 7</code>).

multiCollectSensor1.key = Amp sensor 1
multiCollectSensor1.desc = A CurrentCost supports up to 3 current sensors. Enable this \
	setting to collect samples from sensor <code>1</code>. 

multiCollectSensor2.key = Amp sensor 2
multiCollectSensor2.desc = A CurrentCost supports up to 3 current sensors. Enable this \
	setting to collect samples from sensor <code>2</code>. 

multiCollectSensor3.key = Amp sensor 3
multiCollectSensor3.desc = A CurrentCost supports up to 3 current sensors. Enable this \
	setting to collect samples from sensor <code>3</code>. 

sourceIdFormat.key = Address format
sourceIdFormat.desc = A string format pattern for generating the address values in \
	collected data samples. This format will be passed the raw CurrentCost address \
	(as a <em>string</em>) and the CurrentCost amp sensor index (as an <em>integer</em>).

addressSourceMappingValue.key = Address mapping
addressSourceMappingValue.desc = A key/value mapping of CurrentCost addresses to \
	<code>sourceId</code> values. This can be used to consistently collect \
	data from CurrentCosts, even after the CurrentCost has been reset and \
	it generates a new random address ID value for itself. The syntax is like \
	<b>addr = sourceId, addr2 = sourceId2, ...</b>. Note the address values \
	should be the values <em>after</em> the <b>Address format</b> is applied.

sourceIdFilterValue.key = Source filter
sourceIdFilterValue.desc = A comma-delimited list of <code>sourceId</code> values to accept \
	data for, rejecting all others. Sometimes bogus data can be received \
	or some other CurrentCost message not associated with this node might be received. \
	Configuring this field prevents data from sources other than those \
	configured here from being collected. Note the source values configured \
	here should be the values <em>after</em> any <b>Address mapping</b> \
	translation has occurred.

collectAllSourceIds.key = Collect all sources
collectAllSourceIds.desc = If <em>true</em> then attempt to read values for all sources \
	configured in the <b>sourceIdFilter</b> property and return all the data collected. The \
	<b>collectAllSourceIdsTimeout</b> setting is used to limit the amount of time spent \
	collecting data, as there is no guarantee the application can read from all sources: \
	the CurrentCost data is captured somewhat randomly.

collectAllSourceIdsTimeout.key = Collect all timeout
collectAllSourceIdsTimeout.desc = When <b>collectAllSourceIds</b> is configured as \
	<em>true</em> this is a timeout value, in seconds, the application should spend attempting to \
	collect data from all configured sources. If this amount of time is passed \
	before data for all sources has been collected, the application will give \
	up and just return whatever data it has collected at that point.

sampleCacheMs.key = Sample Maximum Age
sampleCacheMs.desc = The maximum number of milliseconds any sampled data may be cached \
	before refreshing it again from the device.
